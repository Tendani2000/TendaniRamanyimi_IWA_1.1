const firstname = "Alex"
const surname = "Naidoo"
let role = "Head of Marketing"

const display= firstname + surname + ( role );
document.querySelectorm('#alex').innerText = display


/*Why does the code not work?
*There was no const by the private to show the variable must change. It was missing inverted commas
and semi colons
What changes do you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?
add the missing pieces and rename the name and role. Remove the extra pluss signs.
Are there any other ways in which it can be been solved?*/
